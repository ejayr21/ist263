        My Name is Ejay Ramos. I am a Policy Studies major interested in becoming a consultant or becoming a marketing strategist and creating marketing strategies and social media influencer campaigns. I currently work for a marketing agency and Amazon as a marketing strategist and content creator and have worked with various other brands such as Prada, Bed Bath & Beyond, Hollister Co., and Abercrombie & Fitch. I currently am fluent in English and Tagalog, and proficient in Spanish and Italian. Outside of my work, I like to learn about different cultures and traveling. I also enjoy spending time outside on hikes, exploring, and enjoying the fresh air. As someone who enjoys creating content and working for companies I like, I try to use the opportunities I get from my work to also integrate my hobbies such as being able to travel for work
